# REST API Documentation Templates

## In Markdown (for now)

These are templates that were inspired by @iros 's [documentation
gist](https://gist.github.com/iros/3426278).

The focus is on using the templating language, Markdown, to create
comprehensive, structured and helpful API documentation - the structure of
which can be regular and repeated across endpoints and between projects.

There are two parts:

* [Templates](templates) - These are abstracted templates which (for now) can
  be manually copied and filled in.
* [Examples](examples) - For each template, a completed anonymised example.
  Where possible this example comes from a real project.

## Future

* RST translation
* Use of a templating language and helper to create a simple renderer to
  replace the manual copy / paste / replace process.
